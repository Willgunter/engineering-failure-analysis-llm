# Data

This folder is where data was curated, modified, split, summarized, and
transformed during experiments aimed at engineering failure analysis /
extreme-conditions reasoning.

## What’s in this folder

- `data/script.md` — a prompt template used to turn raw technical text into a
  structured analysis (assumptions, governing physics, failure modes, etc.).
- `data/README.md` — this document.

## Dataset summary (historical)

The original dataset used in experiments was assembled from ~200 public
engineering failure analysis articles (e.g., sources like NASA, the US Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, Engineering Failure Analysis, and similar venues).

Two fine-tuning data shapes were tried:

1. **Attempt 1: document-style (“continued pretrain” shape)**  
   Raw sources were kept close to original form (very long examples). This
   produced degraded training behavior (repetition, strange characters, and
   generally low-quality outputs).

2. **Attempt 2: Q/A-style chunks**  
   Each source was split into shorter chunks and paired with an autogenerated
   question to better match typical instruction-following usage. This produced
   more usable behavior on the custom prompt set under `evals/custom-evals/`.

Older notes referenced a conversion script (`attempt1_data_to_qa_style.py`);
that script is **not currently in this repo**.
